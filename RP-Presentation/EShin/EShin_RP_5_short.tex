\begin{frame}{Introduction}

\begin{itemize}

\item In various contexts, many important decisions are made by groups.
\mk

\item Individual heterogeneity exists in various dimensions:
\sk
	\begin{itemize}
	
	\item Risk preference: risk assessment in environmental policy
	\sk
	
	\item Time preference: household savings and consumption decisions
	\sk

	\item Rationality
	
	\end{itemize}
	\mk
	
\item It is important to understand how individual heterogeneity in a collective influences final outcomes.

\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Introduction: Research Questions}

\begin{itemize}

\item[1.] Rationality extension:
	\sk
	\begin{itemize}
	
	\item Do rational members make more collectively rational decisions?
	
	\end{itemize}
	\mk

\item[2] Risk preference aggregation:
	\sk
	\begin{itemize}
	
	\item Are individual's risk preferences reflected into that of a group?
	
	\end{itemize}
	\mk
	
\item[3.] Efficiency and welfare:
	\sk
	\begin{itemize}
	
	\item How is the efficiency of group decisions related to individual's rationality and preferences?
	\sk
	
	\item How is social welfare related to individual' rationality and preferences?

\begin{itemize}

\item We analyze the \textbf{quality} of collective decisions as a function of the degrees of rationality and preference alignment.
\mk

\item Idea: 
\sk
	\begin{itemize}
	
	\item We consider a class of utility functions over lotteries.
	\sk
	
	\item For each subject, we estimate the utility function parametrically.
	\sk
	
	\item We characterize a set of Pareto efficient choices.
	\sk
	
	\item For collective choices which are \textbf{not} Pareto efficient, we measure the degree of welfare loss.
	
	\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% new frame %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Measurement: Utility Estimation}

\begin{itemize}

\item We restrict our attention to a CARA utility function over outcomes.
\mk

\item We consider two different types of utility function over lotteries:
	\sk
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Expected utility (EU)
	\sk
	
	\item Disappointment aversion utility (DAU).
	\end{itemize}
	\mk

\item We estimate $\rho$ and $\beta$ simultaneously by using a combination of a bootstrapping and the non-linear least square (NLLS) methods:
	\sk
	\begin{itemize}
	
	\item[1] Find subsample of size 18 with replacement.
	\sk
	
	\item[2] For given subsample, estimate $\alpha$ and $\rho$  by NLLS.
	\sk
	
	\item[3] Repeat the above for 250 times.
	\sk
	
	\item[4] If $0.5 \in [\alpha_{2.5}, \alpha_{97.5}]$, then set $\alpha = 0.5$ as an EU.
	\sk
	
	\item[4'] Otherwise, set $\alpha = \overline{\alpha}$ as a DAU.

\begin{frame}{Conclusion}

\begin{itemize}

\item We measure rationality and risk preference in individual and group levels.
\mk

\item We observe rationality extension and preference aggregation.
\mk

\item We develop a measure of efficiency and utility loss of group decisions.
\mk

\item We find that rational groups are more likely to make efficient decisions.
	\mk
	
\item Our main findings are robust with respect to
	\sk
	\begin{itemize}
	\item another rationality measure (Varian's efficiency index)
	\sk
	
	\item other cutoff values of CCEI (0.99 or 0.95)
	\sk
	
	\item another measure of risk preferences (risk premium).
