\begin{frame}{Introduction}

\begin{itemize}

\item In various contexts, many important decisions are made by groups.
\mk

\item Heterogeneity in various dimensions:
\sk
	\begin{itemize}
	
	\item Risk preference: risk assessment in environmental policy-making in committees
	\sk
	
	\item Time preference: household savings and consumption decisions.
	\sk

	\item Rationality
	
	\end{itemize}
	\mk
	
\item It is important to understand how individual heterogeneity in a collective influences final outcomes.

\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Introduction: Research Questions}

\begin{itemize}

\item[1.] Rationality extension:
	\sk
	\begin{itemize}
	
	\item If each individual's choices are consistent with a utility maximization model, do a group's choices also tend to be?	
	
	\end{itemize}
	\mk

\item[2] Risk preference aggregation:
	\sk
	\begin{itemize}
	
	\item Are individual's risk preferences reflected into that of a group?
	
	\end{itemize}
	\mk
	
\item[3.] Efficiency:
	\sk
	\begin{itemize}
	
	\item Are group's choices Pareto efficient? 
	\sk
	
	\item How is the efficiency related to group members' rationality and preferences?
	
	\end{itemize}
	
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% new frame %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Introduction: Why Experiments?}

\begin{itemize}

\item The laboratory experiment can be stripped of many confounding factors, and decisions can be observed in a highly \textcolor{tred}{\textbf{controlled environment}}.
\mk

\item By applying the revealed preference theory, we can directly measure rationality and risk preference without noise.
\mk
%\pause

\item Beyond measuring rationality and risk preference, we can investigate how these are \textcolor{tred}{\textbf{aggregated}} in collective decisions.
\mk

\item We finally analyze an efficiency of group decisions as a function of members' rationality and preference.

\item We conducted the experiment in 12 middle schools in Daegu.
\mk

\item The number of students: 1572.
\mk 

\item The number of groups: 786.
\mk

\item The instructions were read by an experiment in each classroom.
\mk
	
\item Each subject participate in two sessions: individual and group decisions.
\mk
	
\item Each session consisted of 18 independent decision rounds.
\mk

\item Each round started by having the computer select a budget line randomly from the set of lines that intersect at least one axis at or above $300$ KRW or below $1500$ KRW.

\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% new frame %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Procedure and Subjects}

\begin{itemize}

\item At the end of each round, the computer randomly selected one of the two states ($\textcolor{tred}{R}$ and $\textcolor{tblue}{B}$).
\mk

\item Subjects were not informed of the state that was actually selected at the end of each round.
\mk

\item Each subject was paid for he/she earned in a randomly selected round.
\mk

\item After every student finishes the first session, the second session begins.
\mk

\item Two students in the same classroom were randomly matched.
\mk

\item A student moved to the other partner's desk and make collective decisions by sharing the computer.
\mk

\item We allowed students to discuss how to make decisions for 1 min before starting the second session.

\begin{itemize}

\item We consider a constant absolute risk aversion (CARA) utility function over outcomes:
	\begin{align*}
	u(x) = - \frac{ e^{- \rho x} }{ \rho }.

\item We consider two different types of utility function over lotteries:
	\sk
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Expected utility (EU) by von Neumann and Morgenstern (1953):
		\begin{align*}
		U(Z) = \frac{1}{2} u(x_{\text{max}}) + \frac{1}{2} u(x_{\text{min}}).
		\end{align*}
	\sk
	
	\item Disappointment aversion utility (DAU) by Gul (1991):
		\begin{align*}
		U(Z) = \alpha u(x_{\text{max}}) + (1-\alpha) u(x_{\text{min}}) \quad \text{where $\alpha = \frac{1}{2+\beta}$}
		\end{align*}
		\begin{itemize}
		\item $\beta > 0$: disappointment aversion
		\sk
		
		\item $-1 < \beta <0$: elation seeking.

\item  We measure the group inefficiency as the average utility loss:
	\sk
	\begin{align*}
	\text{Inefficiency}_{g} = \frac{1}{18} \sum_{k = 1}^{18} \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i = 1}^2 \frac{u_i(x_{ikb}) - u_i(x_{ck})}{u_i(x_{ikb}) - u_i(x_{ike})}.

\begin{frame}{Conclusion}

\begin{itemize}

\item In this paper, we measure rationality and risk preference in both individual and group levels.
\mk

\item More rational individuals are more likely to make rational choices.
\mk

\item More risk-averse individuals are more likely to make risk-averse choices.
\mk

\item More rational groups choices are more likely to efficient decisions.
\mk

\item More preference-aligned individuals need not make efficient decisions.

\begin{frame}{Introduction: Risk Perception}

\begin{itemize}

\item[1.] Genetics: White males wre more likely to perceive risks as being smaller (Bickerstaff, 2004; Flynn et al., 1994).
\mk

\item[2.] Psychology: 
\sk
	\begin{itemize}
	
	\item availability bias

	\item experience

\item[3.] Knowledge and Information: public v.s. experts

\item[4.] Other factors
\sk
	\begin{itemize}
	
	\item culture: Chinese individuals are significantly less risk-averse than individuals from Western countries when making financial decisions (Weber and Hsee, 1998).
	\sk
	
	\item power: high-power groups adopt a more positive attitude toward potential risks (Anderson and Galinsky, 2006; Magee et al., 2007; Geng et al, 2018).
	\sk
	
	\item social inequality: Sweden people with foreign backgrounds did perceive risks as higher than native people, but no difference between men and women.

\item A functional form:

\item Properties:
	\sk
	\begin{itemize}
	
	\item An indifference curve is only partially convex.

	\end{itemize}
	\mk

\item With a CARA (or CRRA) utility function, it can rationalize all the choices except the corner choices.
\mk

\item When there are only two states, it is equivalent to the disappointment-aversion utility function by Gul (1991).
\mk

\item Of course, this utility function is aligned with the first-order stochastic dominance relationships between lotteries.
